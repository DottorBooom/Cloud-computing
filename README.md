## Introduction

+ As written in the description, this course will only be an introduction, as I will not take part in the advanced course.
+ It will be entirely in English, slides made by the professor on which I will take notes lesson after lesson.
+ Some books have also been recommended if you want to follow from there or go deeper, I will try to upload those as well.
+ The final exam will consist of a project assigned by the professor and a written exam.
+ This exam will be the first of the two modules that make up the entire course, the second is called "High performance computing". As soon as I will start it I will put a link in this read.me but you can also find it on my profile.

The professor have is own repository of the course [here](https://github.com/Foundations-of-HPC/Cloud-basic-2024/tree/main)

### What you will learn

**In this course will be introfuceed the basic concepts of cloud computing** 
+ Cloud
+ XaaS
+ Properties and basic implementations

**Modern cloud architecture and infrastructure**
+ Basic concepts and tutorials
+ Computing and Data Cloud

**Virtual Machines and Containers**
+ Whats is a VM and how to use it, experiments with VBox
+ What is a container and how to use it (Docker)

**Attitude**
+ Don't be (only) a user of pre-cooked tools that you consider as black-boxes

### Common rules & principles

+ Every question is **legitimate and useful**, ask what you do not understand
+ Main pourpose it to **learn**, not to grade
+ Learning is a **process**, not a result
+ Nobody is perfect or always right: **errors and mistake are natural**
+ **Learning is a process in our personal brain**, not in other's one. **Clash with your limits** before check the solution

## Intro to course

A simple introduction with what you have to expect from this course. Everything written above is a summary of the lesson.

Slides are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_0/)

## Introduction to cloud computing

Some more detailed information about the course and what to expect, including recommended books. 
Definition of computing and historical overview of how from distributed computing we arrived at cloud computing.

+ Distributed computing architectures and applications
+ Cluster computing 
+ High throughput (capacity) applications and usage
+ GRID computing 
+ Utility computing

Slides are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_1/)

## Cloud main concepts

What is a cloud and what is cloud computing, main concept around the cloud idea, advantage and disadvantage and the cloud architecture.

+ Cloud computing
+ Service attribute, horizontal and vertical scaling
+ Cloud models and architecture
+ What I need for building a cloud
+ Advantage and disadvantage

Slides are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_2/)

## Virtualization

And introduction on what is a virtualization and how it works, why it was created and different approch to virtualization.
The first lab is introduced, where the user have to create a cloud infrastructure made by 3 (or more) VMs that work in an internal network.

+ What is and why it was made
+ How it works and different method
+ What we need to virtualize and how it's menaged by the host
+ The network implementation

Slides and lab are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_3/)

## Benchmark

During the lecture is explained what is a benchmark and why should I use it, what are the main components to address performances. Different tools have been recommended for each component and how to analyze the results obtained.

+ Why benchmarking and on which components
+ How to test every main part and how to analyze the results

Slides are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_4/)

## Container

And introduction on what is a container and how it works, Why it was created and what is different fromt virtualization.

+ What is a container and the difference with VMs
+ Some proprerties and other aspect
+ In-depth anaylis of the structure
+ Some code and example on how to implement it

Slides are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_5/)

## Kubernetes

What are kubernetes and what are the differences with containers.

+ Introduction to kubernetes
+ What they can provide and what not
+ In-depth analysis of the components, and what each one does

Slides are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_6/)

## Data cloud and cloud security

How data cloud system works and how they keep the data protected.

+ Different types od data structure and which whan do what
+ The GFS and the object storage
+ The importance of meta data
+ The architecture behind it
+ Introduction to cloud security and some considerations
+ Different level of security and how to deal with each one
